# Project2 - Nichole Leatehrwood
As Nichole, I want to use this site successfully, so I know I can build it. 

As Emily, I want to use this site to find funny giphs, so I can have fun.

As Karl, I want to see a working site, so I can pass Nichole. 

Overview/description of the project: Create a working giphy search site
Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered: type a word in search bar, hit submit = images of search term
Technologies Used: js, html, css
Ideas for future improvement:  
1. I cannot get it to respond to my media queries.
2. I could make it more robust.
3. I could make the links work.
